# PCA & Fourier transform in Lead analysis using Sentinel-1 data 

Principal component analysis and Fourier transformation code with Sentinel-1 data. Some data is from image classification method in https://github.com/jcbw/Arctic_Lead_Detection used in the PCA analysis, while SAR data is used for the fourier analysis.
